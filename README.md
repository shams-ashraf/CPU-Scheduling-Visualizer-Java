# CPU Scheduling Visualizer (Java GUI)

Java Swing application that visualizes and simulates multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
- FCFS
- SJF
- SRTF
- Priority
- FCAI (custom algorithm)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This is a desktop-based Java application built using Swing that allows users to input custom processes and simulate how various CPU scheduling algorithms manage them.  
It visually displays execution order, timelines, and calculates essential statistics such as:
- Waiting Time
- Turnaround Time
- Completion Time

It supports live color-coded Gantt chart drawing, process tables, and algorithm-specific behavior for learning and demonstration purposes.
